# springboot-spock

Sample project to help configuring spring-boot with the amazing *Spock framework* that makes so easy and intuitive how to write tests. 

In this project I used Java 16 and I wrote all code in Groovy.

To build and execute Unit Tests:
```
mvn clean install
```

To run project locally with H2 database: 
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
