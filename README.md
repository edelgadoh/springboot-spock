# springboot-spock

Sample project to help configure spring-boot with the amazing *spock framework* that makes so easy and intuitive how to write tests. In this simple POC I used Java 16.

To build and execute Unit Tests:
```
mvn clean install
```

To run project locally with H2 database: 
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
